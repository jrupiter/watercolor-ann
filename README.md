Prelaunch Campaign

This campaign was to run from September 17th through November 15th. 
The goal is to capture leads and insert them into a database. 
This particular sign up form will send the user an email two times.
After sign up they will see the first intro page detailing a feature of this application.
A short email will then be sent to the user detailing a benefit. A short link will be available 
in this email leading to the next feature. One more email will be
Sent to the user detailing the benefits of the previous
Intro page and lastly a link will be embedded into the email
To send the user to the last intro page giving them the last feature and benefit. 

The database with the user information will have to remain as is
When two month time frame is completed.
